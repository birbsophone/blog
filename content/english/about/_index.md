Website I made for guides and stuff; while learning self hosting in the process. 

# About the Website Itself
I copied most of the code from the original theme, Ananke. Thanks for that by the way.

This site is hosted on Jacob Collier, who is a 10+ year old laptop with a battery at 40% health, broken screen, and a fried iGPU. 

I chose the name Jacob Collier so that the British white man's soul gets trapped in this hardware until the world explodes.

I also have Discord but prefer not to use the platform if possible.
